Welcome to the BBCA UI Client!

First, you will be prompted to enter a valid username.
You cannot input nonword characters, a blank space, or a username has already been used.
You can input anything except for a blank space.
In the event that you did input a blank space, you will once again be prompted to enter a valid username.

You can now utilize the chat.
Below are some of the chat functions:
 
1. CHAT: Input anything
2. PCHAT: Input "@username CHAT" to chat privately with a user (that has joined the chat) of your choice
3. EMOJIS:
    a. Input ":EMOJINAME:" to send an emoji of your choice (from the available list) to the chat.
    b. Input "/list" to get a list of all available emojis and their names.
4. QUIT: Input "QUIT" to end the client

Thank you for using the BBCA UI Client!
