Welcome to the BBCA UI Client!
First, you will be prompted to enter a valid username.
You can input anything except for a blank space.
In the event that you did input a blank space, you will once again be prompted to enter a valid username.

You can now utilize the chat.
Below are some of the chat functions:

1. CHAT: Input anything
2. PCHAT: Input "@username CHAT" to chat privately with a user of your choice
3. QUIT: Input "/quit" to end the client
4. IDK: Input "idk" to do idk

Thank you for using the BBCA UI Client!
