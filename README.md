Welcome to the BBCA UI Client!

First, you will be prompted to enter a valid username. You cannot input nonword characters, a blank space, or a username already in use. You can input anything except for a blank space. In the event that you did input a blank space, you will once again be prompted to enter a valid username.

You can now utilize the chat. Below are some of the chat functions:

CHAT: Input anything

PCHAT: Input "@username CHAT" to chat privately with a user (that has joined the chat) of your choice

QUIT: Input "QUIT" to end the client

EMOJIS: a. Input ":EMOJI:" to send an emoji of your choice (from the available list) to the chat. b. Input "/list" to get a list of all available emojis and their names. c. Input "/add :EMOJI: (sampleemoji)" to add any emoji of your choice to the list.

PCHAT: Input "@username CHAT" to chat privately with a user of your choice

QUIT: Input "/quit" to end the client

IDK: Input "idk" to do idk

Thank you for using the BBCA UI Client!
